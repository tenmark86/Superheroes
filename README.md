## Project Guidelines
Your project should conform to the following set of guidelines:

## Models
You need to create the following relationships:

- A `Hero` has many `Power`s through `HeroPower`

- A `Power` has many `Hero`s through `HeroPower`

- A `HeroPower` belongs to a `Hero` and belongs to a `Power`

Start by creating the models and migrations for the following database tables:

Add any code needed in the model files to establish the relationships.

Then, run the migrations

You are welcome to generate your own seed data to test the application.

## Validations
Add validations to the `HeroPower` model:

- `strength` must be one of the following values: 'Strong', 'Weak', 'Average'

Add validations to the `Power` model:

- `description` must be present and at least 20 characters long
